:: Some interesting Windows scripting notes that will be of help in
:: understanding this launch script:
:: - If you invoke echo with a variable that evaluates to the empty string,
::   echo will print a status message, not an empty string itself.
::   "help echo" for more info.
:: - Since the equals sign is a metacharacter used in string substitutions,
::   it's very difficult to replace it with something else.  Also, when
::   doing text processing, particularly with invocations of the set builtin,
::   equals signs are interpreted as spaces; this is inexplicable but very
::   much the case.  We hedge against this below by replacing the equals sign
::   character in arguments (e.g. "-Dx=y") with a unique token so that it may
::   be restored later.
:: - Although Windows scripting now allows you to perform blocks of operations
::   within a conditional or loop, the command processor isn't intelligent
::   about handling instances of the block metacharacters (the parenthesis
::   characters, in this case) as values in dereferenced variables.  This
::   causes problems if you want to, say, pass an ASCII property list
::   representation of a string as a value for, say, NSProjectSearchPath.
::   As with the equals sign, we replace these characters with unique tokens
::   so that the characters may be restored later.  This token replacement
::   is much simpler for these characters than it is for the equals sign
::   character, though.
:: - When you echo the character sequence "%%", it collapses to a single "%".
:: - We need to create temporary, helper scripts, and sometimes these scripts
::   echo text to another file.  This is a problem when generating the helper
::   script on the fly, because the act of generating the script itself
::   involves echo text to a file; you run into the difficulty of having
::   stdout redirected twice on the same line, which would confuse the command
::   interpreter.  We rely on an old DOS trick of abusing the prompt builtin to
::   hack together sketchy character sequences in a subshell and harvest the
::   resulting prompt and echo *that* to the script.  All uses of the prompt
::   builtin address this problem alone.  You'll notice that the script line
::   up to the "prompt" keyword is identical in every instance; for more info
::   check "help cmd", "help for" and "help prompt".  This is a trick
::   that should be documented in various Windows scripting sites on the WWW.
:: - Windows scripting doesn't treat single quotes specially.  Don't use single
::   quotes to quote arguments (e.g. arguments that contain spaces) to pass to
::   this launch script.
:: - Setting a variable like "set BLAH=" is the same semantic for undefining a
::   variable.  Instead of checks for whether the value of the variable is
::   empty, all we have to do is check whether the variable is defined.
::   Unfortunately, this sort of check doesn't work for automatic variables
::   such as those used by for loops (e.g. "%%a", etc).
:: - If you echo a variable where the last character of the value is a number,
::   and you redirect this echo to a file, the command processor will try to
::   interpret the number as a file descriptor (e.g. "1>" means stdout, "2>"
::   means stderr), regardless of the number, and will effectively eat the
::   number.  This causes big problems if you pass arguments to the script
::   like "-DNSDebugLevel=1".  You need to ensure that a space always follows
::   the echo invocation before the redirection.

:: Turn off echo.
